# **Understanding the Browser**

A browser is nothing but a piece of software that can be used to access any resource that is being hosted on the internet. Most of the browsers are capable of displaying any kind of media i.e web pages, images, videos, pdf's etc. 
Every resource that is hosted on the internet has a unique id which is called as Uniform resource Identifier. 

There are different browsers that are developed by different companies such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge. 

There are different versions of browsers available for different sizes of devices such as mobiles and desktops.

### **How does a web browser work?**

Now, we have understood what a browser is. But that's not enough. So, now let's understand the internal functioning of it.

First, whenever you enter the url in the address bar and hit enter then the browser sends the request to something that is called as a Domain Name Server shortly called as DNS. So what's a DNS?

#### Domain Name Server :

It is similar to the phonebook that we would use in the early days. It basically consists of a list of people and their corresponding phone numbers. It is same with the DNS but here we have the domain names and their corresponding ip address.

 DomainName | IPAddress
 ---------- | ---------
 abc.com | 192.56.39.184 
 xyz.com | 192.58.40.196

Now the responsibilty of the DNS server is to look up the domain name that is requested by the browser i.e user in the list and return the corresponding ip address.

Back to the browser again. Now the response that is send by the DNS server is received by the browser and now browser sends a request asking for the resource that is hosted on that particular address on the internet.The server sends the requested resource to the browser.

Now , the browser renders the resource by using certain languages. They are:

**1) HTML :** HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. This language consists of several html tags.The browser uses this tags to identify the type of content and how to display it.

**2) CSS :** CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. CSS is used to specify how the content should be displayed on the web page.

**3) JS :** JS stands for Javascript. JS is used to make the web page to respond to user actions. Every web browser has a dedicated javascript engine. V8 is google chrome's javascript engine, Spider Monkey is the javascript engine of Mozilla Firefox, Chakra is the javascript engine of Microsoft Edge.

This is the basic overview of a web browser. Apart from this, web browser consists of various debugging tools and utilities to test the performance of the website and the browser.
